After a prolonged pause, he replied: ‘I don’t know that. I must ask you not to say that, as if we took it for granted.’</p><p>‘But if you do care for her, so much the more should you leave her to herself.’</p><p>Having again paused as before, Eugene said: ‘I don’t know that, either. But tell me. Did you ever see me take so much trouble about anything, as about this disappearance of hers? I ask, for information.’</p><p>‘My dear Eugene, I wish I ever had!’</p><p>‘Then you have not? Just so. You confirm my own impression. Does that look as if I cared for her?
