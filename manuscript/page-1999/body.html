She soon proved to be a baby of wonderful intelligence, evincing the strongest objection to her grandmotherâ€™s society, and being invariably seized with a painful acidity of the stomach when that dignified lady honoured her with any attention.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">It was charming to see Bella contemplating this baby, and finding out her own dimples in that tiny reflection, as if she were looking in the glass without personal vanity. Her cherubic father justly remarked to her husband that the baby seemed to make her younger than before, reminding him of the days when she had a pet doll and used to talk to it as she carried it about.
