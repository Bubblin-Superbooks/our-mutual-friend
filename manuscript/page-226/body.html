Is business bad?’</p><p>‘Never was so good.’</p><p>‘Is your hand out at all?’</p><p>‘Never was so well in. Mr Wegg, I’m not only first in the trade, but I’m <em>the</em> trade. You may go and buy a skeleton at the West End if you like, and pay the West End price, but it’ll be my putting together. I’ve as much to do as I can possibly do, with the assistance of my young man, and I take a pride and a pleasure in it.’</p><p>Mr Venus thus delivers himself, his right hand extended, his smoking saucer in his left hand, protesting as though he were going to burst into a flood of tears.</p><p>‘That ain’t a state of things to make you low, Mr Venus.’</p></div> </div>
