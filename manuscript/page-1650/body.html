The information may be of use to you, if only to prevent your credulity, in judging another man’s truthfulness by your own, from being imposed upon.’</p><p>‘Impossible!’ cries Twemlow, standing aghast. ‘How do you know it?’</p><p>‘I scarcely know how I know it. The whole train of circumstances seemed to take fire at once, and show it to me.’</p><p>‘Oh! Then you have no proof.’</p></div> </div>
