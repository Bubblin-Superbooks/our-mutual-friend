It is only in the conviction that I may trust you never to betray me, that I can proceed. Sincerely promise me that you never will betray my confidence—that you will respect it, even though you may no longer respect me,—and I shall be as satisfied as if you had sworn it.’</p><p>‘Madam, on the honour of a poor gentleman—’</p><p>‘Thank you. I can desire no more. Mr Twemlow, I implore you to save that child!’</p><p>‘That child?’</p><p>‘Georgiana. She will be sacrificed. She will be inveigled and married to that connexion of yours. It is a partnership affair, a money-speculation. She has no strength of will or character to help herself and she is on the brink of being sold into wretchedness for life.’</p></div> </div>
