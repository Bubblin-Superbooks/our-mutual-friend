<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr Lammle, all a-glitter, produces his friend Fledgeby, as dying for the honour of presentation to Lady Tippins. Fledgeby presented, has the air of going to say something, has the air of going to say nothing, has an air successively of meditation, of resignation, and of desolation, backs on Brewer, makes the tour of Boots, and fades into the extreme background, feeling for his whisker, as if it might have turned up since he was there five minutes ago.</p><p>But Lammle has him out again before he has so much as completely ascertained the bareness of the land. He would seem to be in a bad way, Fledgeby; for Lammle represents him as dying again. He is dying now, of want of presentation to Twemlow.</p><p>Twemlow offers his hand. Glad to see him. ‘Your mother, sir, was a connexion of mine.’</p><p>‘I believe so,’ says Fledgeby, ‘but my mother and her family were two.’</p></div> </div>
