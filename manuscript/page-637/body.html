<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">wonder how it happens that when I am work, work, working here, all alone in the summer-time, I smell flowers.’</p><p>‘As a commonplace individual, I should say,’ Eugene suggested languidly—for he was growing weary of the person of the house—‘that you smell flowers because you <em>do</em> smell flowers.’</p><p>‘No I don’t,’ said the little creature, resting one arm upon the elbow of her chair, resting her chin upon that hand, and looking vacantly before her; ‘this is not a flowery neighbourhood. It’s anything but that. And yet as I sit at work, I smell miles of flowers. I smell roses, till I think I see the rose-leaves lying in heaps, bushels, on the floor. I smell fallen leaves, till I put down my hand—so—and expect to make them rustle. I smell the white and the pink May in the hedges, and all sorts of flowers that I never was among. For I have seen very few flowers indeed, in my life.’</p></div> </div>
