And I’ll tell you why, Rokesmith. A man of property, like me, is bound to consider the market-price.

I mustn’t go putting the market-price up, because money may happen not to be an object with me. A sheep is worth so much in the market, and I ought to give it and no more. A secretary is worth so much in the market, and I ought to give it and no more. However, I don’t mind stretching a point with you.’</p></div> </div>
