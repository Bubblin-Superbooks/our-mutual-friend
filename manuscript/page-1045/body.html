I knew she would put herself in the way, if she could, and would be sure to strike in with something impertinent. It was on that account that I proposed our going to the City to-night and meeting my sister.’</p><p>‘So I supposed,’ said Bradley, getting his gloves on his nervous hands as he walked. ‘So I supposed.’</p><p>‘Nobody but my sister,’ pursued Charley, ‘would have found out such an extraordinary companion. She has done it in a ridiculous fancy of giving herself up to another. She told me so, that night when we went there.’</p><p>‘Why should she give herself up to the dressmaker?’ asked Bradley.</p><p>‘Oh!’ said the boy, colouring. ‘One of her romantic ideas!
